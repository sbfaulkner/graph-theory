# graph_theory

This repo is my exploration of Graph Theory, as guided by http://theoryofprogramming.com/

## exercise 1 - http://theoryofprogramming.com/2014/12/24/graph-theory-basics/

- discuss basic graph concepts.
- explain adjacency matrix
- explain and implement adjacency list

## exercise 2 - http://theoryofprogramming.com/2014/12/25/breadth-first-search-algorithm/

- explain and implement breadth first search algorithm

## exercise 3 - http://theoryofprogramming.com/2014/12/25/snakes-and-ladders-game-code/

- explains modeling of snakes and ladders as a graph
- explain and implement breadth first search to find shortest path for completion of snakes and ladders

## exercise 4 - http://theoryofprogramming.com/2014/12/26/depth-first-search-algorithm/

- explain and implement depth first search algorithm
